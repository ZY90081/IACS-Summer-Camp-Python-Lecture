When we write `for a in numlist:` we're creating a new variable called `a`, and inside `a`, we store the first element of `numlist` (which is 1). We then execute the indented code in the for loop. At the next iteration of the loop, the value of `a` will be changed to be the next element of `numlist` (in this case, 2). This will continue until `a` takes the value of the last element in `numlist`. Note that the variable name `a` is arbitrary. We could name this variable whatever we want, as long as we're consistent inside the loop. A common convention (and good coding practice to make your code understandable!) is to use a variable name that describes what is inside the list. For this loop, we could have used the variable name `number` since each thing inside `numlist` is a number.\n",

For the given example, the answer would be -5. Then modify your solution to instead find the index.)"
