    "## What are fractals?\n",
    "The term fractal (from the Latin fractus, meaning “broken”) was coined by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. In his seminal work “The Fractal Geometry of Nature,” he defines a fractal as “a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, fractals often describe or at least resemble objects in nature, such as trees, mountain ranges, snowflakes, coastlines, blood vessels, lightning bolts, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical definition of a fractal is rather complex, and we will not worry about it for now. Instead, we will focus on a defining feature of fractals, their *self-similarity*, and how this manifests when we write programs to create factals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with a normal geometric shape, say a circle or a square. If we zoom in to a part of these shapes, we get a straight or curved line:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"not_fractal.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The zoomed pictures obviously do not resemble the full shapes, thus these simple examples are not self-similar, and not fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what would a simple fractal look like? Say we define an algorithm to make a tree. This agorithm involves drawing a \"root\" (straight line) with two \"branches\" coming off at angles from the end. Each one of these branches has its own two branches, and so on. If we draw a picture of this and zoom in we see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ch08_04.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking closely at any branch gives something that looks like the tree itself. Therefore, this geometric construction is *self-similar*!\n",
    "\n",
    "This self-similarity provides a relationship between fractals and the idea of *recursion* we discussed earlier in the course.  For example, in drawing this tree, we may write a function which, in pseudocode, might look something like:\n"

    "In the simple case of the tree, you could imagine from the definition of how to draw the shape that it would look like a fractal. But it does not need to be so exact and straightforward. In the real world, most fractals are *stochastic* fractals, which means that they are built out of probabilities and randomness. They are not exactly self-similar, but still have *scale-invarience*: zooming in on the image produces an image with the same type of features, such that you could not tell how much it was zoomed without a scale included. \n",

But, in principle, to actually be self-similar the true fractal has infinite depth, so the more you zoom in, the more triangles you see on each line segment. Thus the more you zoom *the longer the curve you measure*. Since a coastline is also truly fractal, the same issue appears in cartography!
